The National Technical Honor Society is an honor society that values self-exploration and professional development in CTE education.

Founded by Perry Han and Nathan Che in 2022, The National Technical Honor Society Whitney High School chapter strives to unite various CTE clubs and students in their journey for career education.

Mission Statement: *To unite the various clubs supporting career development and offer recognition of independent student success in CTE programs, resulting in an increase in career exploration activity and college recognition for students involved with the program.*

NTHS empowers your favorite career clubs in 5 seperate departments:

- Business Administration and Law
- Medicine and Health
- Performing Arts and Entertainment
- STEM
- Visual and Practical Arts

By participating frequently in member club activities and meetings, you engage in valuable career experience that can benefit you for your professional life. NTHS takes that a step further by recognizing exemplary individuals at Whitney (like you!) and providing additional, rewarding opportunities that can accelerate your professional development.
